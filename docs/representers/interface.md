# The Interface

All interactions with the Exercism website are handled automatically. Representers have the single responsibility of taking a solution and returning a representation of it. See the [introduction](./introduction.md) for more information.

## Execution

- A Representer should provide an executable script. You can find more information in the [docker.md](../docker.md) file.
- The script will receive two parameters:
  - The slug of the exercise (e.g. `two-fer`).
  - A path to a directory containing the submitted file(s) (with a trailing slash).
- The script must write a file to that directory named `representation.txt`

## Output format

The `representation.txt` file contain some sort of canconical representation (normally an AST)

## Debugging

The contents of `stdout` and `stderr` from each run will be persisted into files that can be viewed later.

You may write an `representation.out` file that contains debugging information you want to later view.

At a later date, we will provide an interface for you to download these files along with the submitted files and `representation.txt`.
